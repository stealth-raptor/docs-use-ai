# 🧠 DoC.AI – AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support Tool

DoC.AI is an AI-powered clinical decision support system tailored for junior doctors and medical residents in India. It simplifies critical healthcare workflows like diagnosis, prescription writing, and real-time assistance, reducing human error and improving patient outcomes. The platform is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and reliable in high-pressure clinical environments.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🩺 Diagnosis Maker**  
  An intelligent tool that analyzes patient details—such as symptoms, medical history, and vitals—to generate structured, clinically sound diagnoses. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate diagnostic reasoning similar to that of an experienced medical professional.

- **👨‍⚕️ Copilot**  
  A real-time conversational assistant for doctors. It helps answer medical queries, suggests next steps in diagnosis or treatment, and supports clinical decision-making. It acts like a medical co-pilot, assisting without replacing the practitioner’s judgment.

- **💊 Prescription Generator**  
  Automatically generates concise and safe prescriptions based on the diagnosis. It includes dosage, timing, and important instructions, all formatted into a clean JSON structure. The prescriptions adhere to standard clinical guidelines and reduce time spent on manual entry.

- **📃 Smart Summaries (Coming Soon)** 
Generate detailed yet concise clinical notes and patient visit summaries that are EMR-ready. Ideal for documentation, referrals, and medico-legal use cases.

- **🔍 Powered By Cutting-Edge AI** 
DoC.AI now leverages Gemini 2.5 Flash, Google's latest multimodal large language model, for improved contextual reasoning, faster inference, and enhanced medical language understanding.
